# Machine Learning Classification of Variables Needed to Determine Gender Inequality Index (GII). 
## Abigail Parakoyi 

# Overview 
This project takes a data set from the Kaggle [gender inequality index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gianinamariapetrascu/gender-inequality-index) and applied three regression machine learning models (Multiple regression, decision tree, and neural network) and an bagged ensemble model to determine which feature variables drive the gender inequality index (GII).
